# Hospitality-Analytics-Dashboard

📊 Project Overview
This project presents an interactive Power BI dashboard designed for the hotel business (hospitality industry).
It analyzes performance across hotel properties in Delhi, Mumbai, and Hyderabad, focusing on KPIs such as:
Revenue (₹1.71B+ total)
Occupancy % (~58% average)
RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room)
ADR (Average Daily Rate)
Realisation % (~5%)
Cancellations (~25%)
The dashboard enables management to compare business vs luxury categories, evaluate booking platforms, and analyze weekly revenue trends, helping drive data-driven pricing and occupancy strategies.

🚀 Key Insights
💰 Mumbai properties generate the highest revenue, followed by Delhi and Hyderabad.
🛏 Luxury hotels achieve higher ADR (₹12,696) but lower occupancy % compared to Business hotels.
📅 Weekend occupancy is higher than weekdays, indicating strong leisure demand.
🌐 Direct online bookings deliver better realisation % compared to offline and third-party platforms.
📊 Weekly trend analysis (W20–W32) shows Luxury contributes ~62% of revenue, with peaks in Week 28.
